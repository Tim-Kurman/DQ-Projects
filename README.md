Projects I've done as homework for Dataquest: a self-paced codecamp.
Basic Python - just general python scripting, getting to learn the basics
Data Analysis/Vis - going through pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn
Data Cleaning - working with large datasets and cleaning them up
Machine Learning - working on it right now
Probability and Statistics - building spam filters, running lottery numbers, etc.
SQL - working with SQL through Postgres
